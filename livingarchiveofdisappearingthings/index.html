        <h2>Islands</h2>
        <p>The cryosphere, the frozen water on Earth's surface, is melting at unprecedented rates. As a direct result, sea levels are predicted to rise by 1.1 meters by the 2100. If sea level continues to rise at the current rates, nations of people will be forcibly displaced from their homes and entire cultures will be largely lost.</p>

                    <h3>Maldives</h3>
                    <img src = "media/maldives.jpg" alt="Birds eye view of one of the Maldive islands" style="width:30%;"/>
                    <p>The Maldives, a collection of 1190 islands in the Indian Ocean, is the flattest country on the planet. With 80% of the country less than 1m above sea level, the Maldives are extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels. 
                        Although the Maldives are only responsible for 0.0003% of global emissions, they are already suffering from the servere impact of climate change due to the location and size of the islands. Currently, 90% of the islands 
                        have experienced flooding, 97% have experienced shoreline erosion and 64% have experienced serial erosion.

                    <h3>Tuvalu</h3>
                    <img src = "/media/tuvalu.jpg" alt="Birds eye view of one of the thin coast of Tuvalu" style="width:30%;"/>
                    <p>Tuvalu is a collection of 9 small islands in the Pacific ocean, located midway between Hawaii and Australia. Positioned only 3m above sea level and only 20m across (at its narrowest region), Tuvalu is at high risk of submergence due to rises in sea level and heavy coastal erosion from increasingly intense weather patterns. In addition to frequent flooding, Tuvalu experiences
                        extreme temperatures as a result of green house gas emissions from industrialised nations. Many locals predict that their land will be fully submerged and uninhabitable within the next 50 years. While Australia has offered Tuvuluans citizenship, it is contigent on Tuvuluans giving up their fishing and maritime rights. The Tuvaluan government has
                        rejected this as imperialist behavior and remain committed to preserving their land, culture and sovereignity.

        <h2>Wildlife</h2>
        <p>Human consumption of natural resources and wild spaces is tiggering extreme losses to our planet's biodiversity. Humans extract from ecosystems at 1.56 times the rate the planet is able to regenerate, creating ecological imbalances that harshly disupts wildlife.
            According to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/06/720654249/1-million-animal-and-plant-species-face-extinction-risk-u-n-report-says">a report published by the United Nations</a>, 1 million of the 8 million plant and animal species are currently at risk for extinction.

                <h3>Bumblebees</h3>
                <img src = "/media/bee-on-purple-flower.jpg" alt="Bumble bee pollinating purple flower" style="width:30%;"/>
                <p>Rising temperatures and drier climates are leading to a rapid decline in the bumblebee population. When temperatures are high, bumblebees will stop pollinating and use their energy to fan their colonies.
                    Since the start of the 21st century alone, the likelihood of bumblebee species being present in an area has decreased by 46% in North America and 17% in Europe. Local extinctions are occuring at 8 times the rate the formation of new colonies. In other words, bumblebess are 
                    disappearing at 8 times the rate they are able to replace themselves.

                <h3>Whales</h3>
                <img src = "/media/right-whales.jpg" alt="A Right Whale, one of the most at-risk whale species, under water" style="width:30%;"/>
                <p>Rising ocean temperatures are causing a disruption of whale habitats, and is dramatically affecting their ability to reproduce and migration patterns. Higher water temperatures is causing crustacean populations to plummet, creating shortages of food availability for whales. 
                    For example, Right Whales, who reside in the North Atlantic Ocean, have been forced to msigrate further north to cooler waters, due to higher competition for food in their normal habitats. The safegaurds against fishing and ships that exists in the North Atlantic do not necessarily exist 
                    in these new areas, causing right whales to die from entanglement in gear or collisions with ships. Other whale populations, such as beluga and bowhead whales, are diminishing as a result of decreases in krill that result from heightened UV radiation from our depleted ozone layer.
