          longDesc: "The Maldives, a collection of 1190 islands in the Indian Ocean, is the flattest country on the planet. With 80% of the country less than 1m above sea level, the Maldives are extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels. Although the Maldives are only responsible for 0.0003% of global emissions, they are already suffering from the servere impact of climate change due to the location and size of the islands. Currently, 90% of the islands have experienced flooding, 97% have experienced shoreline erosion and 64% have experienced serial erosion.",

        longDesc: "Rising temperatures and drier climates are leading to a rapid decline in the bumblebee population. When temperatures are high, bumblebees will stop pollinating and use their energy to fan their colonies.\n\nSince the start of the 21st century alone, the likelihood of bumblebee species being present in an area has decreased by 46% in North America and 17% in Europe. Local extinctions are occuring at 8 times the rate the formation of new colonies. In other words, Bumblebess are disappearing at 8 times the rate they are able to replace themselves.",

          shortDesc: "Tuvalu is a collection of 9 small islands in the Pacific ocean, located midway between Hawaii and Australia. Positioned only 3m above sea level and only 20m across (at its narrowest region), Tuvalu is at high risk of submergence due to rises in sea level and heavy coastal erosion from increasingly intense weather patterns.",
          longDesc: "Tuvalu is a collection of 9 small islands in the Pacific ocean, located midway between Hawaii and Australia. Positioned only 3m above sea level and only 20m across (at its narrowest region), Tuvalu is at high risk of submergence due to rises in sea level and heavy coastal erosion from increasingly intense weather patterns. In addition to frequent flooding, Tuvalu experiences extreme temperatures as a result of green house gas emissions from industrialised nations. Many locals predict that their land will be fully submerged and uninhabitable within the next 50 years. While Australia has offered Tuvuluans citizenship, it is contigent on Tuvuluans giving up their fishing and maritime rights. The Tuvaluan government has rejected this as imperialist behavior and remain committed to preserving their land, culture and sovereignity.",

        name: "RIGHT WHALE",
        shortDesc: "Rising ocean temperatures have disrupted the reproductive rates and migration of North Atlantic right whales. In 2010, higher water temperatures caused crustacean populations to severely plummet around the Gulf of Maine, the traditional home for right whales. This has forced right whales to since migrate north to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where they are not protected against ships and fishing gear.",
        longDesc: "   Limited food supply has decreased the rates of reproduction of right whales who need a thick layer of blubber in order to get pregnant and give birth. While more than 85% of right whales have faced entanglement with fishing gear, females are also more likely to die from their injuries due to added stresses of pregnancy. This has caused an increasing imbalance between males and females also contributing to the drop in reproduction rates.\n\n    The drop in birth rate and rise in death rates accounts for the 26% decline in the population over the past decade alone which has left only 356 counted right whales.\n\n    The lag in policy to adapt to climate change has caused an incline in death rate of right whales from collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing nets. While Canada and the U.S has both introduced regulations on shipping and fishing to address the migration of right whales, these changes are still primarily reactionary. It is likely that climate changes force new migration of right whales and policy must be introduced to prepare for this.\n ",

        name: "CORAL REEFS",
        shortDesc: "The ocean has absorbed about 30% of CO2 produced by humans since the late 18th century, triggering severse changes to the coral reefs ecosystem. Warmer temperatures, higher acidity levels, higher water levels and changes in ocean currents have caused 14% of the corals reefs to be lost since 2009.",
        longDesc: "Rising water temperture is causing mass coral bleaching, a process where coral releases algae that live inside its tissue, exposing its white exoskeleton. The higher acidity levels of the water cause coral skeletons to break down and also limit coral growth. More severe and frequent storms and cyclones seen in the 21st century lead to destruction of reefs. More polluted waters also lead to coral smothering, a build up of sediment on the surface of coral that block light and create lesions.",
